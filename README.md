__What does it do?__
- Loads Strings from the Web into the client
- Automatically load them when you enter the World
- Automatically redownload them after a certain amount of time
- Apply string to Text, Text Mesh Pro and Text Mesh Pro UGUI components
- Use a separate string while Loading
- Use a separate string if you encounter an error
- Optionally: Allows you to control it through Udon# (this is very WIP)

__How to use:__
- add the Unity Package to your Project
- add the Simple Picture Loader script to what ever gameobject you want the string to be loaded on
- add Text Mesh Pro if it asks you to

You can also take a look at the Example Scene & Prefab if you want to see how it can be used.
